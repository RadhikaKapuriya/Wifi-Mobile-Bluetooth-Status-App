# Wifi/Mobile/Bluetooth Status App
 This Application Shows the current bluetooth and network status (on / off / mobile data). The top half of the application shows the WiFi status while the bottom half of the application would show the Bluetooth status. If the network is changed off / on manually from the settings, the application should update it's status. Additionally, there is a persistent notification on the user's notification tray that shows the bluetooth and wifi status all the time. The notification will work off of a background service and will continue to work in the background and update the notification tray even when the application is removed from the recent applications.
